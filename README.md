currently only script for analysing data from open field. Program takes cordinates of a centroid (from rat tracking system) draws plot showing movements accros an arena - and returns time (seconds) spent by a rat in center of an arena and in outer zone (near walls) as well as distance (in cm) traveled in both zones.
